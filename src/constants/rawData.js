    html: '&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love Makoto Shinkai&amp;#39;s stories, their characters are complex, but the storytelling is very sutil, the first time that I saw The Garden of Words, I couldn&amp;#39;t understand it&amp;#39;s complexity at once, so I think the way he writes is sublime, and your name is like The next step, it has complex characters, but in some way the story is more easy to enjoy without too much analysis, so I think this last part is what makes it popular.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also the first time that I saw it I thought it was the typical change of body story, but it is much more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;',

    body: "I would actually disagree that the characters are complex, Mitsuha is by far the strongest character and carries a lot of the emotional core herself (well it's more the connection shared between them) but I wouldn't say she's overally complex. Taki, like most of Shinkai's male leads, are pretty repalceable, forgettable and generic. \n\nI don't necessarily find that that detracts from the film though. Sure, if Taki had his own character arc that tied in with the plot/story that could make it even better. I saw someone criticise Shinkai of doing 'melodramas' and that's pretty accurate; he focuses more on outlandish plots (at least in Your Name) and evoking emotions rather than characterisation. And for Your Name I think that works just fine.\n\nI think Shinkai successfully manages to convey the 'feeling' and evoke emotions that were universally felt, though not necessarily fully grasped; there wasn't meant to be a concrete message or a specific philosophy that shaped the narrative (kind of what you were saying about an easy to enjoy story). We all feel the emptiness and melancholia of the connection they share being lost to time and space... he takes some shortcuts with the plot and exposition in order to convey these feelings but I think I can forgive it given how successfully and how powerful the emotions he delivered to the viewer were.",

    body: "‚ÄúNothing more... nothing less... than a beautiful view.‚Äù\n\nAround the 20th of April last year, I watched ‚ÄòYour Name‚Äô. It was a movie I had heard all about. One of the critics I followed loved it (Chris Stuckmann) and it was talked about all around the community. I knew I had to watch it. But since it wasn‚Äôt in cinemas when I wanted to watch it, I had to buy a DVD (I didn‚Äôt have and still don‚Äôt have a blu-ray. Plan on buying a blu-ray player and ‚ÄòYour Name‚Äô again). There was a lot of build up to watching this movie, since it took a little while for the movie to actually get to my house. But then on that day, on the 20th of April, I finally watched it.\n\nI don‚Äôt think I can explain my experience through words. There was something about this movie that just clicked with me. Whether it was the characters or the story, something about it just‚Ä¶ did something to me‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄòYour Name‚Äô follows Taki and Mitsuha, two high school students who live on two very different parts of Japan, one being in the middle of Tokyo and one being in the country. One day, the two strangers switch bodies with each other. With Taki in Mitsuha‚Äôs body, and Mitsuha in Taki‚Äôs. We get to see how Taki and Mitsuha have to change their lives for each other. We see them grow and change through this body switch.\n\nI am a person who likes to have everything in a movie to be as great as possible. I want the characters to be good, I want the story to be good, I want the visuals to be good. I want everything in a movie or show to be good. Now, this has lead to me thinking more about movies with my head rather than the heart. It has lead to me rating a movie/show lower cause I realized that the characters weren‚Äôt that memorable. It has led to me not feeling anything, cause I was just thinking.\n\nIf I look back at this film, it never feels as good as it does when you watch it. I look at the characters, and the story, and the music separately which leads me to slowly dislike the film. It‚Äôs not that I realize things about the aspects that make it worse, but just some weird feeling that it isn‚Äôt as good as I thought.\n\nBut when I watch this film, there is just something that happens. I‚Äôm completely engrossed by its story and characters, that it is hard to see some of the mistakes. Cause there are mistakes and flaws in this film for sure.\n\nThe characters could‚Äôve had a little more depth, the story had some holes and the third act felt a little slower than the rest.\n\nBut whenever I actually watch the film, all of those flaws disappear in my head. The characters feel real and I‚Äôm invested in the story. I don‚Äôt think I can explain through text how much I love this movie. But I‚Äôll try.\n\nMy favorite part of ‚ÄòYour name‚Äô is how its story and characters have a connection. It doesn‚Äôt feel as if they wrote a story, and then wrote characters. They never felt separated but were completely connected. That the characters develop through this body change that occurs multiple times under the film. That Mitsuha and Taki learn about their desired lifestyle. How Mitsuha learns how stressful the life in the city is or how Taki learns about culture and connection in the country (it is never stated that Taki dislikes his life in the city, but it was something I wanted to add since Mitsuha shows the stress that is in the city). That Taki doesn‚Äôt do anything with his life until Mitsuha changes that, and how he repays her by saving her life.\n\nOr how the story has themes of what the Japanese society is becoming. That they are drifting away from culture (religion) and into modernization and politics. About wanting to keep a balance between culture and modernization. A whether you should uphold tradition, or be yourself.\n\nAnd how all of that being connected with the dreams that the main cast experience, of how they get to see how their wished lives would‚Äôve been. They get to see whether or not it is their culture or their dreams they want to take force in their future. Whether they want to continue to live the life they have lived all of their lives, or if they want to make a risk and maybe feel a little uncomfortable but in the end live a better life.\n\nIn the end, I think the characters and story both embody the constant struggle between the two sides.\n\nBut then there‚Äôs also the constant feeling of looking for something that might fulfill themselves that is referenced. Whether it is a person, a place, or even just a job.\n\nThere are a lot of movies and shows that have a character or a plot element that I find relatable. But this the first time I felt the same about a feeling expressed in a medium. Maybe I explained it badly. The feeling of trying to find something that might fulfill yourself is something I think everyone has felt. Or maybe not even fulfill, but just trying to find something, cause you have the constant feeling that you need to find it.\n\nI can‚Äôt believe I have gone through this review this long without mentioning the art.\n\nThere are a lot of shows and movies I would consider visual masterpieces. Like ‚ÄòSpiderman into the spiderverse‚Äô, ‚ÄòA Silent Voice‚Äô or Ridley Scott‚Äôs ‚ÄòAlien‚Äô. And while I would still consider them a few of the most visually appealing movies of all time, there is something about ‚ÄòYour name\\* that makes it so beautiful. Whether it is the incredibly detailed backgrounds that fit so incredibly well with the fantastic, or if it‚Äôs the coloring that brings the emotion so well together with its shading. It is a mystery I have yet to solve, but want to keep a secret. To have something to have unexplained.\n\nAnd I can‚Äôt not bring up the music. Wow, what an amazing score. The work by ‚ÄòRadwimps‚Äô is honestly something I admire completely. It is one of the few soundtracks that I almost remember completely. It is what makes many of the scenes into what they really are. It‚Äôs what makes so many of the scenes bone-chilling. It‚Äôs what makes so many of the scenes so marveling.\n\nAt the end of the day, I absolutely love ‚ÄòYour Name‚Äô. It is a movie that I think I will have in my mind for all of my life. A movie whose score will be stuck in my head for eternity. A movie who‚Äôs visuals will be ingrained in my brain. And a story of which will be cemented into my soul.\n\nI have seen movies that I think are as good as Your name. 2001 a space odyssey, a clockwork orange are both two movies I think are about as good as this film. But in those two, it is more the thought-provoking and complicated story that they have. They aren‚Äôt necessarily movies that are made for the heart, but are still amazing for it. But when I watch ‚ÄòYour Name‚Äô, something about it just grabs me. I don‚Äôt know what it is, but the first time I watched it, I loved it completely. But I don‚Äôt know how to describe it. It isn‚Äôt a sad film, not necessarily a realistic one nor a romantic one. You could probably describe in many ways. but for me - it is the unnamable. Nothing more, nothing less, than a beautiful film\n\n[https://letterboxd.com/artistwithaname/film/your-name/2/](https://letterboxd.com/artistwithaname/film/your-name/2/)\n\nEdit: I‚Äôm honestly so glad I made this (these) posts. Whether it is negative or positive, I‚Äôm just glad that people are talking about Your Name again. I never really wanted to do a review of it, but I‚Äôm glad I did!\n\nEdit 2: And last thing. I can go on and on about why I love this film. I can analyze every aspect of it. But the fact of the matter is that there is just one thing that makes me love it so much. Cause it makes me happy. I haven‚Äôt really felt that good for the past years. I‚Äôm not sad, not happy, I just feel an emptiness where my feeling should be. But whenever I watch this film or listen to it‚Äôs score, I‚Äôm happy. Or at least I think I am. I can feel a warmth inside of myself when I watch it, and I think that‚Äôs it. It has problems, but it makes me happy every time I watch it. And therefore, it is one of the best movies I have seen",

The interview is about Suzume specifically, but mentions his feelings about Your Name as well.\n&gt;When the disaster happened in 2011... it shook the whole country to the core, myself included. It changed many things. It changed society, and it changed my approach to animation. I gradually started to feel a sense of guilt in making anime. I felt that I wasn't helping anyone if I was simply making anime. The job of creating anime felt useless in helping the earthquake victims. But eventually... I started to explore ways to face and understand disasters that are only possible through anime and entertainment.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;That led me to making Your Name. and Weathering With You and finally found my way to making Suzume. What I've been feeling in the process of making anime since 2011 is that not just earthquakes, but disasters in general are becoming more common in our lives. We're seeing more disasters. Japan has frequent earthquakes. Aside from earthquakes, the climate crisis is causing extremely heavy rain worldwide. We also experienced a global pandemic.\n\n\n\n&gt;The pandemic started while I was working on Suzume. Our lives are now surrounded by disasters, and it probably won't decrease in number. We need to learn to live side-by-side with disasters. Since 2011, this feeling has grown inside me with each passing year. So it wasn't that I was trying to make a film on natural disasters. But if I wanted to tell a contemporary story, I couldn't avoid the topic. That's how I see it. \n\n\n\n&gt;So with Suzume it started out as the coming-of-age story of a girl, but as I thought about where in Japan she'd travel and how and why she'd grow, I simply couldn't skirt around the topic.

That's my honest feeling.\n\nhttps://www.crunchyroll.com/news/interviews/2023/4/28/interview-suzume-director-makoto-shinkai-on-healing-a-wounded-nation-through-anime\n\nThere's also stuff about coming of age and the red string of fate but it's more like a feeling to me that the movie gives than something I could analyze properly.",
