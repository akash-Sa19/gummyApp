It's my first time on ios but i'm not a stranger to it because we have an ipad. \n\nHere are my pros:\n\n&gt; battery is superior(a bit better compared to my wife's s23u)\n&gt; phone speaker is top notch\n&gt; camera operation is faster and transition between lenses is more fluid\n&gt; camera quality when on social media apps are much better(i dont use it but it's better)\n&gt; always on display is much better\n\nCons:\n\n&gt; no universal back gesture (Can't use one hand properly because of this. Always have to reach for the top left to go back. Funny thing is it's not even consistent, sometimes it's on the lower left on some apps\n&gt; placement of the action button makes it useless. It's in a hard to reach spot when using one hand so it's faster to just open the phone\n&gt; Home screen is a mess. You can grouo them into folders but still a mess and harder to organize vs Oneui\n&gt; Several times i've had issues receiving a text. I tested it by sending a text message from s23u and i would receive the message after maybe 5 mins. When i reply back, the s23u would receive it right away\n&gt; notification center is a mess compared to one ui's or any androids\n&gt; always have to go to Settings app to change settings from some apps\n&gt; in my use case I think fingerprint is more convenient than face id. When working and want to check something from my phone lying on the table, I hate that i have to bring it up and face id vs just using fingerprint\n&gt; s23u feels snappier. Yes it does. Faster swipes and the screen refresh rate is more consistently at 120hz than my 15pm\n\nI just think you can do things faster on one ui and it's easier to use one handed even considering the latest oneui update where the drop down menu pushed some things higher. \n\nI'm debating on returning my phone and wait for the s24u. Or maybe im just too used to oneui and i need to spend more time on ios.",
